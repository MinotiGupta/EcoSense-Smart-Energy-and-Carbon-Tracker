## About the Project 
The project EcoSense is an innovative system designed to monitor ana analyze the power consumption of household devices. 
It can detect anomalies in usuage patterns, and estimate the carbon footprint. 
Objectives of the project includes: 
1. Real-Time Power monitering: To deisgn a system to measure and display real-time power consumption of multiple household devices
2. Anomaly Detection: Using LSTM deep learning model
3. Measure Carbon Footprint: The model can calculate the associated carbon footprint of each household in respective of Tamil Nadu region.
4. The power consumption and carbon footprint can be viewed using Blynk app.
Why our project stands out?
It incorporates region-specific carbon footprint calculations. It includes the integration of renewable energy contributions to power consumption. 
This eco-friendly approach encourages users to make an informed decision about their energy consumption contributing to a sustainable future.
